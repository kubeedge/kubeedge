# Detect whether the base system is using iptables-legacy or
# iptables-nft. This assumes that some non-containerized process (eg
# kubelet) has already created some iptables rules.

# Bugs in iptables-nft 1.8.3 may cause it to get stuck in a loop in
# some circumstances, so we have to run the nft check in a timeout. To
# avoid hitting that timeout, we only bother to even check nft if
# legacy iptables was empty / mostly empty.
