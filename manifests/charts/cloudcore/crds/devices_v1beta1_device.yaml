                    Twin provides a logical representation of control properties (writable properties in the
                    device model). The properties can have a Desired state and a Reported state. The cloud configures
                    the `Desired`state of a device property and this configuration update is pushed to the edge node.
                    The mapper sends a command to the device to change this property value as per the desired state .
                    It receives the `Reported` state of the property once the previous operation is complete and sends
                    the reported state to the cloud. Offline device interaction in the edge is possible via twin
                    properties for control/command operations.

                    Twin provides a logical representation of control properties (writable properties in the
                    device model). The properties can have a Desired state and a Reported state. The cloud configures
                    the `Desired`state of a device property and this configuration update is pushed to the edge node.
                    The mapper sends a command to the device to change this property value as per the desired state .
                    It receives the `Reported` state of the property once the previous operation is complete and sends
                    the reported state to the cloud. Offline device interaction in the edge is possible via twin
                    properties for control/command operations.

                        The meaning of here is to indicate desired value of `deviceProperty.Desired`
                        that the mapper has received in current cycle.
                        Useful in cases that people want to check whether the mapper is working
                        appropriately and its internal status is up-to-date.
                        This value should be only updated by devicecontroller upstream.
