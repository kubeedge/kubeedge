## Summary
In some scenarios, we may want to deploy an application among several locations. In this case, the typical practice is to write a deployment for each location, which means we have to manage several deployments for one application. With the number of applications and their required locations continuously increasing, it will be more and more complicated to manage.  
The node group management feature will help users to manage nodes in groups, and also provide a way to control how to spread pods among node groups and how to run different editions of pod instances in different node groups.

## Motivation
In edge computing scenarios, nodes are geographically distributed. The same application may be deployed on nodes at different locations.

Taking Deployment as an example, the traditional practice is to set the same label for edge nodes in the same location, and then create Deployment per location. Different deployments will deploy applications at different locations specified by their NodeSelector.

However, with the number of locations increasing, operation and maintenance of applications become more and more complex. 

### Goals
* Use a single resource to manage an application deployed at different locations.
* Users can specify the number of pods and the differences of pod instances running in each node group.
* Non-intrusive for kubernetes native control plane
* Limit service endpoints in the same location as the client pod, called service scope feature below.

### Non-goals
* Create another systematic machanism to take over the work of application lifetime management, such as rolling update which is the responsibility of deployment.
* Create a new CRD for each kind of application.

## Design Details
### Architecture
![image](../images/node-group-management/group-management-arch.png)

The implementation consists of two components. a new `GroupManagementControllerManager` and the endpointslice filter in the `cloudcore`. The `GroupManagementControllerManager` contains controllers of new CRDs, including `NodeGroupController` and `EdgeApplicationController`. The endpointslice filter is used to filter endpoints in endpointslices before sending them to the edgecore so as to make edgecore only aware of the endpoints in the same node group.

NodeGroup will organize nodes according to their labels which should be set based on their locations in advance, `location: hangzhou` and `location: beijing` in this case. After applying the NodeGroup resource, nodes will be grouped in `hangzhou` and `beijing` logically.

The EdgeApplication resource contains the template of the application to deploy.Through EdgeApplication API, users can apply the different editions of the application template for each node group, such as specifying the image registry for each node group. After applying the EdgeApplication resource, the EdgeApplication controller will take the application template and override it generating serval different editions according to the specification. And then these applications will run in their nodegroups respectively.

### GroupManagementControllerManager 
`GroupManagementControllerManager` contains two controllers, called `NodeGroupController`, and `EdgeApplicationController`, which take over the lifetime mangement of EdgeApplication and NodeGroup respectively.

#### NodeGroupController
`NodeGroupController` is responsible for collecting nodes belonging to the NodeGroup according to node names or labels and filling the status field. `NodeGroupController` watches the nodegroup resource and node resource. When nodes are added, deleted or their labels are updated, it will add/remove these nodes in/from the relative node groups.

#### EdgeApplicationController
`EdgeApplicationController` is responsible for creating, updating and deleting the subresources manifested in the EdgeApplication.
1. When EdgeApplication has been created, it will create and override the subresource for each specified node group.
2. When EdgeApplication has been updated, it will update relative fields of subresources.
3. When EdgeApplication has been deleted, it will delete all manifested subresources.  

### EndpointSlice Filter in CloudCore
The endpointslice filter in cloudcore takes the responsibility of filtering out endpoints in the endpointslice before sending them to the edge. Clients, possibly kube-proxy, at edge which ask for the endpointslice from the cloudcore will only get endpointslice containing endpoints in their node groups. Thus, the pod, for example running in the node group A, can only reach endpoints in node group A.

### NodeGroup API
NodeGroup represents a group of nodes that have the same labels.
```go
// NodeGroup is the Schema for the nodegroups API
type NodeGroup struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

	// Spec represents the specification of the desired behavior of member nodegroup.
	// +required
	Spec NodeGroupSpec `json:"spec"`

	// Status represents the status of member nodegroup.
	// +optional

```

### EdgeApplication API
EdgeApplication contains the template of the application orgainzed by node groups. It also contains the information of how to deploy different editions of the application to different node groups.

## Use Cases
* Create NodeGroup CRs to specify some node groups and nodes belonging to them.
* Fill the `EdgeAppSpec.WorkloadTemplate` field of EdgeApplication with the application you want to deploy.
* Fill the `EdgeAppSpec.WorkloadScope` field of EdgeApplication to specify the instance numbers or other differences for each node group where you want to deploy the application.
* Apply the EdgeApplication resource and check its status. 

### Example
We give an example of how to use NodeGroup and PropagationPolicy APIs. 

Assuming that we have 5 nodes at edge, 2 in Hangzhou and 3 in Beijing, called NodeA, NodeB, NodeC, NodeD and NodeE respectively. NodeA and NodeB, which are located in Hangzhou, have the label `location: hangzhou`. NodeC, NodeD and NodeE, which are located in Beijing, have the label `location: beijing`. We want to apply a deployment called nginx, having 2 instances in Hangzhou and 3 instances in Beijing. And we want to use the service scope feature making them can only be reached when clients are in the same node group as the pod instance.

First, we create nodegroups called beijing and hangzhou. The yaml is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeedge.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeGroup
metadata:
  name: hangzhou
spec:
  matchLabels:
    location: hangzhou
---
apiVersion: apps.kubeedge.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeGroup
metadata:
  name: beijing 
spec:
  matchLabels:
    location: beijing
```

Second, create the EdgeApplication resource. In this case, we want 2 pods to run in Hangzhou and 3 pods to run in Beijing. Also, we want these pods to use their local image registry and enable the service scope feature. Thus, we can apply the EdgeApplication like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeedge.io/v1alpha1
kind: EdgeApplication
metadata:
  name: nginx-app 
spec:
  workloadTemplate:
    manifests:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
    - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: nginx
      ports:
      - name: http
        protocol: TCP
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      type: LoadBalancer
  workloadScopes:
    targetNodeGroups:
      - name: hangzhou
        overriders:
          replicas: 2
          imageOverrider:
            - component: "registry"
              operator: "replace"
              value: "hangzhou.registry.io"
      - name: beijing
        overriders:
          replicas: 3
          imageOverrider:
            - component: "registry"
              operator: "replace"
              value: "beijing.registry.io"
```
Then two deployments called `nginx-hangzhou` and `nginx-beijing` will be created for hangzhou nodegroup and beijing nodegroup with `replicas: 2` and `replicas: 3` respectively. Pods running in hangzhou nodegroup will use the image `hangzhou.registry.io/nginx:latest` and pods running in beijing nodegroup will use the image `beijing.resistry.io/nginx.latest`. 

The service in the EdgeApplication will also be created and injected with label `groupmanagement.kubeedge.io/edgeapplication-name: nginx-app`. The endpointslice filter in the cloudcore will check the relative EdgeApplication when sending the endpointslice to the edgecore in some nodegroup. It will filter out endpoints not in that nodegroup. Then, clients running in hangzhou node group can only reach the 2 pod instances that are also running in hangzhou node group. The situation of beijing node group is the same.
