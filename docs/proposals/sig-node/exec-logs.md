# KubeEdge Support Logs Exec Proposal 

## Abstract

Currently, in a native kubernetes cluster, `kubectl exec` command can execute a command in a container. `kubectl logs` command can print the logs for a container in a pod. `kubectl attach` command can attach to a running container.

Users can execute these commands in the cloud and do not need to operate on the nodes.

In this proposal, we plan to implement `kubectl exec`, `kubectl logs` and `kubectl attach` feature based on edge computing scenarios

## Motivation

For `kubectl exec` commands, kube-apiserver will establish a long connection with kubelet.

The native kubernetes cluster is set up in data center, so kube-apiserver can directly access kubelet.

However, in edge computing scenarios, edge nodes are mostly in private network environments, and kube-apiserver cannot directly access edge nodes, so the native `kubectl exec`, `kubectl logs` and `kubectl attach` commands can not work.

Therefore, we need to establish a data tunnel to forward data requestes between the cloud and the node.

## Goals

1. Support `kubectl exec`, `kubectl logs` and `kubectl attach` in edge computing scenarios.
2. Ensure the security of data transmission in the tunnel.
3. Do not modify the code of kube-apiserver.


## Architecture Design

In kubernetes, take `kubectl exec` as an example. After kubectl exec, there will be a new process to establish a http connection with kube-apiserver, then the connection will be upgraded to [SPDY protocol](https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper) by default.

```
POST https://{kube-apiserver ip}:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/nginx-8698df6f97-b52l6/exec?command=bash&container=nginx&stdin=true&stdout=true&tty=true
Request Headers:
     X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v4.channel.k8s.io
     X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v3.channel.k8s.io
     X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v2.channel.k8s.io
     X-Stream-Protocol-Version: channel.k8s.io
     User-Agent: kubectl/v1.15.3 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/2d3c76f
Response Headers:
     Connection: Upgrade
     Upgrade: SPDY/3.1
     X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v4.channel.k8s.io

```

After this, kube-apiserver will initiate SPDY connection with the kubernetes node.

```
Connecting to backend proxy (intercepting redirects) https://{node ip}:10250/exec/default/nginx-8698df6f97-b52l6/nginx?command=bash&input=1&output=1&tty=1
Headers: 
	Connection:Upgrade 
	Upgrade:SPDY/3.1 
	User-Agent:kubectl/v1.15.3 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/2d3c76f
```

The flowchart is as follows:

In the edge computing scenarios, kube-apiserver cannot directly access the node and cannot initiate a connection, so we need to do something:

1. Using a websocket-based tunnel between cloud and edge side and forward kube-apiserver connection requests. This channel can be used as a transmission channel for `/metric` data in the future.

	For the tunnel channel, we have two options:

	+ 1-1 We can use (cloudhub <-> edgehub) tunnel, but now cloudhub and edgehub are mainly used to transfer kubernetes resource data (pod, node, configmap, service ...), which is not very suitable for `exec, attach and logs` streaming data transmission.
	+ 1-2 Re-establish a websocket tunnel between cloudcore and edgecore and supports TLS authentication.
		
	This proposal chooses the second solution. The new tunnel is specifically responsible for the forwarding of streaming data, which can be used as `/metric` data transmission tunnel without affecting the logic of cloudhub and edgehub. 

	In most cases, we consider users to use `exec, attach and logs` commands for debugging purposes. In edge computing scenarios, disconnection due to network instability is considered acceptable. Therefore, in the first stage, we do not support the reliable transmission of messages in this tunnel. 
	
	For cloudcore, we need to add a tunnel module, which listens on port 10350 by default (different from 10250), and needs to support websocket and spdy protocols. Both websocket connection requests from edgecore and apiserver connection requests must be supported.
	
	For edgecore, we need to add a tunnel module to initiate a websocket connection to the cloud tunnel. After receiving the data from the cloud, the tunnel calls the CRI interface to communicate with the container runtime.

The process is as follows:
	<img src="../../images/proposals/kubeedge-exec-con3.png">


For the data transmission in the tunnel proxy, there are several considerations:

- In order to distinguish the data of `logs, exec, attach, /metric` connection types, we need to add type definition to distinguish these data.
- Distinguish which connection the data belongs to. We need to use a session-like definition.
- cloudcore tunnel needs to support SPDY and websocket protocols.
- Supports TLS authentication.

The message structure is as follows (working in process ...)：

```
type TunnelMsg struct {
	ConnectID      int64
	messageType    MessageType 
	data	       []byte
}
```


2. Redirect requests made by kube-apiserver to the cloud tunnel service 

We will not modify the code of kube-apiserver, so the connection request address initiated by kube-apiserver is {edgenodeip}:10250, and the 10250 port is getted by (`node.Status.DaemonEndpoints.KubeletEndpoint.Port`), so we need DNAT.

```
 kubectl get node {nodename} -o=jsonpath="{.status.daemonEndpoints.kubeletEndpoint['Port']}"
```

    First of all, we need to modify the logic of edged module. When updating the node status, set the `Status.DaemonEndpoints.KubeletEndpoint.Port` to 10350 by default, so for all edge nodes, kube-apiserver will request 10350 port, which can distinguish the connection of cloud node (10250 port).

On all hosts where kube-apiserver is running, we need to execute the following command:

```shell

iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp  --dport 10350 -j DNAT --to {cloudcoreip}:10350

```

The flowchart is as follows:

## Detail Design

The following figure shows the interaction details and message processing flow among modules. We will add cloudstream modules in CloudCore and edgestream modules in EdgeCore.

<img src="../../images/proposals/kubectl-exec-detail.png">

1. CloudStream in CloudCore

We will start two servers in cloudstream module, streamserver and tunnel server. Streamserver is used to listen and serve request from kube-apiserver. Tunnelserver is used to establish a websocket connection with edgestream and listen response from edge.

For each method(exec, logs, attach and metrics), we will new a corresponding interface `APIServerConnection`, including `ContainerLogsConnection`, `ContainerExecConnection`. For example It contains some functions like: 

```
type APIServerConnection interface {
	fmt.Stringer
	// SendConnection indicates send EdgedConnection to edge
	SendConnection() (stream.EdgedConnection, error)
	// WriteToTunnel indicates writing message to tunnel
	WriteToTunnel(m *stream.Message) error
	// WriteToAPIServer indicates writing data to apiserver response
	WriteToAPIServer(p []byte) (n int, err error)
	// SetMessageID indicates set messageid for it`s connection
	// Every APIServerConnection has his unique message id
	SetMessageID(id uint64)
	GetMessageID() uint64
	// Serve indicates handling his own logic
	Serve() error
	// SetEdgePeerDone indicates send specifical message to let edge peer exist
	SetEdgePeerDone()
	// EdgePeerDone indicates whether edge peer ends
	EdgePeerDone() chan struct{}
}
```

We need to complete the implementation of these functions, which are used to achieve operations like send message to edge, write response data to apiserver and etc.

Cloudstream uses `session` struct to indicates a tunnel connection from edgecore. we use key value pair(nodename:session or internalIP:session) to save the connection from corresponding edgenode. 

```
type Session struct {
	// sessionID indicates the unique id of session
	sessionID string

	// tunnel indicates  a tunnel connection between edgecore and cloudcore
	// default is websocket
	tunnel stream.SafeWriteTunneler
	// tunnelClosed indicates whether tunnel closed
	tunnelClosed bool

	// apiServerConn indicates a connection request made by multiple apiserver to one edgecore
	apiServerConn map[uint64]APIServerConnection
	apiConnlock   *sync.RWMutex
}
```

2. EdgeStream in EdgeCore

Edgestream in EdgeCore also starts a server used to listen and serve the websocket connection with cloudstream. The server path is `/v1/kubeedge/connect`. 

According to the type of message(exec, logs, attach and metrics), edgestream will initiate different request connections to `edged`. Therefore we also define `EdgedConnection` interface to indicate the connection request from `edgestream` to `edged` in path `pkg/stream/edgedlogconnection.go`.

```
// EdgedConnection indicate the connection request to the edged
type EdgedConnection interface {
	CreateConnectMessage() (*Message, error)
	Serve(tunnel SafeWriteTunneler) error
	CacheTunnelMessage(msg *Message)
	GetMessageID() uint64
	CloseReadChannel()
	CleanChannel()
	fmt.Stringer
}
```

For each method, we need to complete the functions above. The `Serve` function is used to send the request to edged and write the response to the tunnel connection.
