## KubeEdge Conformance Test Proposal

### Background

More and more vendors provide edge computing solutions based on KubeEdge. Many vendors requested the KubeEdge community to provide conformance testing and certification to ensure the **interoperability across the commercial KubeEdge offerings** and the **standardization** **of the KubeEdge ecosystem**.

### Certified Procedure Proposal

##### 1. Build & Release

- Build and release **conformance testing tool** based on the corresponding KubeEdge version
- Release conformance test **instructions docs**

##### 2. Testing

- Users get conformance test tool and follow the instructions for testing
- Output test reports, including **e2e.log, junit.yaml, README.md** and **PRODUCT.yaml**

##### 3. Upload Report

Submit reports to *cncf/kubeedge-conformance* repository

##### 4. Certified Results (need help from CNCF)

- Design the KubeEdge conformance Certificate logo
- Vendors display the Certified KubeEdge logo
- *Display vendors product logo in the website*
