## Community Expectations

KubeEdge is a community project driven by its community which strives to promote a healthy, friendly and productive environment.
The goal of the community is to develop a cloud native edge computing platform built on top of Kubernetes to manage edge nodes and devices at scale and demonstrate resiliency, reliability in offline scenarios. To build a platform at such scale requires the support of a community with similar aspirations.

- See [Community Membership](community.md) for a list of various community roles. With gradual contributions, one can move up in the chain.
