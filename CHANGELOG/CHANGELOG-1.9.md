### 1.9 What's New


- **Support Custom HTTP Request Routing from Edge to Cloud through ServiceBus for Applications**

A HTTP server is added to ServiceBus, to support custom http request routing from edge to cloud
for applications. This simplifies the rest api access with http server on the cloud while client is in the edge.

Refer to the links for more details.
([#3254](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/3254), [#3301](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3301))



- **Support CloudCore to run independently of the Kubernetes Master host**

CloudCore now supports to run independently of the Kubernetes Master host, iptablesmanager has been added as an independent
component, users only need to deploy the iptablesmanager to Kubernetes Master host, which now can
add the iptable rules for Cloud-Edge tunnel automatically

Refer to the links for more details.
([#3265](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3265))



- **EdgeMesh add tls and encryption security**

EdgeMesh's tunnel module adds tls and encryption security capabilities.
These features bring more secure protection measures to the user's edgemesh-server component and
reduce the risk of edgemesh-server being attacked.

Refer to the links for more details.
([EdgeMesh#127](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh/pull/127))



- **Enhanced the ease of use of EdgeMesh**

EdgeMesh has many improvements in ease of use. Now users can easily deploy EdgeMesh's server and
agent components with a single command of helm. At the same time, the restriction on service port
naming is removed, and the docker0 dependency is removed, making it easier for users to use EdgeMesh.

Refer to the links for more details.
([EdgeMesh#123](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh/pull/123), [EdgeMesh#126](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh/pull/126), [EdgeMesh#136](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh/pull/136), [EdgeMesh#175](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh/pull/175         ))


- **Support containerized deployment of CloudCore using Helm**

CloudCore now supports containerized deployment using Helm, which provides better containerized deployment experience.

Refer to the links for more details.
([#3265](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3265))


- **Support compiled into rpm package and installed on OS such as openEuler using yum package manager**

KubeEdge now supports compiled into rpm package and installed on OS such as openEuler using yum package manager.

Refer to the links for more details.
([#3089](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3089), [#3171](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3171))


### Important Steps before Upgrading

If you want to deploy CloudCore independently of Kubernetes Master host, please deploy the independent iptablesmanager.

Refer to the links for more details.
([#3265](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3265))
